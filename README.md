# SDEV PSEUDOCODE

This is my **highly** niche extension to provide syntax highlighting for the SDEV pseudocode syntax.

![Basic Use](img/basic-use-optimized.gif)

## Features

Provides highlighting for most keywords. I've also tried to add the formatting for nested conditionals or loops

## Using

Create a file with the .sdev extension

## Limitations

This is something I quickly threw together, so you're going to find missing things or bugs. 

Feel free to sbmit a pull request. or an issue but i dont know when i'll get to it.
